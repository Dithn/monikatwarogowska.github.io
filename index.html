	Mountains are for me the quintessence of nature: beautiful and unpredictable. Climbing mountains is to experience this beauty and at the same time, to be continuously challenged by their hostility. I love going higher, further and discovering deeper. It means setting new goals, training hard, learning new skills and staying positive despite mental and physical exhaustion - in other words, feeling alive.
      </p>

	As an applied mathematician I find similar beauty and adventure when I use mathematical and numerical methods to build conceptual models that predict behaviors and optimize strategies, when I analyze experiments, explain complex processes and create new solutions. But my work is also about something more: it is focused on improving things around us and our lives.

	After masters degree in applied physics and in mathematical engineering, a Ph.D in mathematics and six years of academic research at leading universities and research institutions, I have gained a multidisciplinary experience that can help to identify crucial details, relationships and unusual patterns. I can solve problems based on clear evidence by combining my research skills (analytical, mathematical and programming) with creativity and scientific intuition - using logic and different points of view to see patterns and what is reasonable or not.
      </p>

      <p>
	New projects are like a journey: setting a goal, then investigating problems, researching, learning new methods and tools, to finally creating optimal solutions that satisfy the initial objectives and communicating the results. It motivates me to continuously improve and collaborate with specialists from different fields in order to best contribute to tasks leading to innovations in natural sciences, medicine, engineering or finance and business.
