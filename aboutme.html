	Mountains are for me the quintessence of nature: beautiful and unpredictable. Climbing mountains is to experience this beauty  and at the same time, to be continuously challenged by their hostility. I love going higher, further and discovering deeper. It means setting new goals, training hard, learning new skills and staying positive despite mental and physical exhaustion - in other words, feeling alive.
      </p>

	As a researcher, I find similar beauty and adventure in science.  With creativity, knowledge and intuition I use mathematics and programming to build predictive models, develop optimized strategies, analyze experiments and explain complex behaviours. What is more: my work is also about improving our lives.
      </p>

      <p>
	New projects are like a journey: setting a goal, then investigating problems, researching, learning new methods and tools, to finally creating optimal solutions that satisfy the initial objectives and communicating the results. It motivates me to continuously improve and collaborate with specialists from different fields in order to best contribute to tasks leading to innovations in natural sciences, medicine, engineering or finance and business.
