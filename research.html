	    <h2> My research in brief:</h2>
	    <p>
	      The area of my research is applied mathematics and numerical computing, where I model mathematically real-life problems - arising in physics, biology or economy - and simulate them numerically. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      These type of approach, modeling and simulation, has become an essential tool in most of the modern science. Thanks to a mathematical description we may perform analysis, which leads to better understanding of the observed phenomena, we can predict experimental results, which are hard to perform in laboratories, we can optimize and increase the performances of various processes. Models can have a form of ordinal, partial or stochastic differential equations, moving agents and particles and describe evolution of certain quantities subject to physical, biological or social forces. So far my main focus was on systems of conservation laws and reaction-advection-diffusion equations with time and space dependent source terms, non constant parameters, and non-local fluxes, non-trivial stationary solutions, asymptotic behaviors triggered by changes of some parameters. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Numerical simulations of pde models have to be based on efficient and accurate numerical methods. Increasing available computational power does not guarantee preservation the properties of mathematical systems such as positivity of densities, asymptotic behavior of solutions and stabilization on non constant equilibria. 
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <h3> My research results are centered on: </h3>
	      <ul>
		<li> Mathematical modeling to describe through partial differential equations real life phenomena such as pedestrian motion, cells dynamics and intracellular processes
		</li>
		<li>
		  Numerical methods and software based on well-balanced finite volume schemes for balance laws and non-linear reaction-diffusion problems with nonlinearities, non constant parameters, non-local interactions, vacuum and degeneracy
		</li>
		<li>
		  Numerical analysis of mathematical models for which explicit analysis is unavailable, to predict the experimental results and optimize processes
		</li>
	      </ul>
